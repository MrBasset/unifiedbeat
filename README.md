# Unifiedbeat

Unifiedbeat reads records from [Unified2](http://manual.snort.org/node44.html) binary files
generated by network intrusion detection software and indexes the records in [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/).

Unified2 files are created by [IDS/IPS software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_prevention_system)
such as [Snort](https://www.snort.org/) and [Suricata](http://suricata-ids.org/).

This project is the modification of a [Filebeat](https://github.com/elastic/filebeat) clone from
the November 2015 github repository.

#### Usage

1. download a linux 64bit [release](https://github.com/cleesmith/unifiedbeat/releases)
1. or, if you wish to build from source:
  * ```git clone https://github.com/cleesmith/unifiedbeat```
  * ```cd unifiedbeat```
  * godep usage:
    * ```export GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1```
    * ```godep save```
  * ```go build```
    * if building on linux 64bit platform, or if building on mac/windows do:
      * ```env GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build```
  * copy/scp unifiedbeat binary file to the server with unified2 files to be indexed
1. ```mkdir unifiedbeat```
1. ```cd unifiedbeat```
1. copy or scp the unifiedbeat binary file to the unifiedbeat folder
1. ```curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_template/unifiedbeat' -d@etc/unifiedbeat.template.json```
1. ```rm .unifiedbeat``` if exists ... this file tracks the previous positions within the unified2 files being tailed and indexed
1. ```nano or vim etc/unifiedbeat.yml``` then change:
  * unifiedbeat:
    * rules:
      * gen_msg_map_path: **?**  _# the absolute full path, typically: /etc/snort/gen-msg.map_
      * paths: **?**  _# where are the .rules files, typically: /etc/snort/rules/*.rules_
    * prospectors:
      * paths: **?**  _# where are the unfied2 files, typically: /var/log/snort/snort.log*_
  * . &nbsp; . &nbsp; .
  * output:
    * elasticsearch:
      * hosts: ["**?.?.?.?:9200**"]  _# elasticsearch's ip:port - most securely/typically on the same host as Snort_
1. ```cp etc/unifiedbeat.yml /etc/unifiedbeat.yml``` ... this is not required but typically done
1. **./unifiedbeat** -c /etc/unifiedbeat.yml
  * typically this command would be in a systemd, Upstart, or SysV (init.d) script
  * for a quick test use: ```nohup ./unifiedbeat -c /etc/unifiedbeat.yml &```
1. now, use Kibana to see what's up with your server and network
