# Unifiedbeat

Unifiedbeat reads records from [Unified2](http://manual.snort.org/node44.html) binary files generated by network intrusion detection software and indexes the records in [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/).
Unified2 files are created by [IDS/IPS software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_prevention_system)
such as [Snort](https://www.snort.org/) and [Suricata](http://suricata-ids.org/).

> In addition to using Kibana, a GoLang web app called [Pakquery](https://github.com/cleesmith/pakquery)
> is also available for searching within the data indexed by unifiedbeat. Pakquery's searches
> use the same simple Lucene syntax as in Kibana. However, pakquery is aware of the connection
> between **event and packet record types** based on the **event_id** field. This means that
> one can click on an event record and see the complete event/packet details, or one can
> click on a packet record and see the complete event/packet details.
