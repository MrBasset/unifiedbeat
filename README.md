# Unifiedbeat

Unifiedbeat reads records from [Unified2](http://manual.snort.org/node44.html) binary files generated by network intrusion detection software and indexes the records in [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/).
Unified2 files are created by [IDS/IPS software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_prevention_system)
such as [Snort](https://www.snort.org/) and [Suricata](http://suricata-ids.org/).
